/**
 * Point every user at a role, and give accounts an off switch.
 *
 * `deactivated_at` is how a user is "removed": they can no longer log in or
 * request a password reset, but the row survives so the audit log keeps
 * naming a real person. Nothing in the app hard-deletes a user.
 *
 * Rollout: the account named by ROLE_ROLLOUT_ADMIN_EMAIL (see config/roles.php)
 * becomes the Administrator and everyone else lands on Registrar, which is what
 * they can already do today minus user/role management. If that isn't set, or
 * names an address with no account, the oldest account is promoted instead —
 * the one thing this migration must never do is leave the app with nobody who
 * can manage users.
